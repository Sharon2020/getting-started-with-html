<br><b>SHARONS NOTES</b>
<br>
<br><b>THE BASICS OF WEB AND HTML</b></br>
<P>The main type of document on the world wide web is HTML (hyper text markup language).
  The type of files found on the web include plain text, HTML, videos, and music. Your browser 
  sends requests to the internet which uses HTTP Protocol to communicate with servers. HTTP is the 
  main protocol of the web. Servers are computers that host the files that make up the web. 
  The Internet is the worlds largest computer. Your browser is the program that runs on your 
  computer to display files found on the web.
  </P>
 <P>HTML is made up of text content (what you see), markup (what it looks like), references
  to other documents (images and videos), and links to other pages. 
  <br>Tags have an opening and closing tag with the content in the middle and the whole thing is called 
  an element. Tags can include attributes as well. A void tag has no contents and does 
  not need a closing tag. Span and Div elements only contain their contents and attributes 
  can change the style.
  <br>Inline elements are just text and block elements actually make
  a box that can have a height and width associated with it. a, span, br, img, and strong
  are inline elements. div, p, and form are block elements.
